    <h1>Soil Health Card Scheme 2025</h1>
    <p>Improve Soil Fertility, Crop Yield & Sustainable Farming</p>
</header>

<main>

    <p>
        Soil is the foundation of agriculture, and its health directly determines crop productivity, food security, and farmer income. In India, decades of excessive fertilizer use, monocropping, and improper land management have led to declining soil fertility. To address this challenge, the Government of India launched the <strong>Soil Health Card Scheme</strong>, a landmark initiative aimed at promoting balanced nutrient management and sustainable farming practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Soil Health Card Scheme empowers farmers with scientific information about their soil, helping them make informed decisions about fertilizer use, crop selection, and soil improvement measures. This article explains everything you need to know about the Soil Health Card Scheme, its objectives, benefits, working process, and its long-term impact on Indian agriculture.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is a Soil Health Card?</h2>

    <p>
        A <a href="https://pmkisan-yojana.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soil health card</a> is a printed or digital report provided to farmers that contains detailed information about the nutrient status of their agricultural land. It indicates whether the soil is deficient, sufficient, or excessive in essential nutrients and provides crop-wise fertilizer recommendations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The card is based on scientific soil testing and helps farmers avoid indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers. By following soil health card recommendations, farmers can reduce input costs while maintaining or improving crop yields.
    </p>

    <h2>Launch and Background of Soil Health Card Scheme</h2>

    <p>
        The Soil Health Card Scheme was launched in 2015 with the objective of issuing soil health cards to farmers every two years. The scheme is implemented by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in collaboration with state governments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under this scheme, soil samples are collected from farmers’ fields, tested in laboratories, and analyzed for key soil parameters. The results are then communicated to farmers in a simple and understandable format.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives of the Soil Health Card Scheme</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Assess the nutrient status of soil scientifically</li>
        <li>Promote balanced use of fertilizers</li>
        <li>Reduce soil degradation and nutrient imbalance</li>
        <li>Increase crop productivity and farm income</li>
        <li>Encourage sustainable and environment-friendly farming</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Parameters Tested Under Soil Health Card</h2>

    <p>
        Soil samples collected under the scheme are tested for various physical and chemical properties, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Soil pH</li>
        <li>Electrical Conductivity (EC)</li>
        <li>Organic Carbon</li>
        <li>Nitrogen (N)</li>
        <li>Phosphorus (P)</li>
        <li>Potassium (K)</li>
        <li>Secondary nutrients like Sulphur</li>
        <li>Micronutrients such as Zinc, Iron, Copper, and Boron</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the Soil Health Card Scheme Works</h2>

    <p>
        The implementation of the Soil Health Card Scheme follows a structured process:
    </p>

    <h3>Soil Sample Collection</h3>
    <p>
        Soil samples are collected from farmers’ fields using a grid-based sampling method. This ensures accurate representation of soil conditions in a particular area.
    </p>

    <h3>Laboratory Testing</h3>
    <p>
        The samples are tested in government-approved soil testing laboratories using standardized procedures to ensure reliable results.
    </p>

    <h3>Generation of Soil Health Card</h3>
    <p>
        Based on test results, soil health cards are generated with easy-to-understand symbols, color codes, and fertilizer recommendations.
    </p>

    <h3>Distribution to Farmers</h3>
    <p>
        Farmers receive soil health cards through agriculture departments, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), or online portals.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of Soil Health Card for Farmers</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Reduced expenditure on fertilizers</li>
        <li>Improved soil fertility and structure</li>
        <li>Higher crop yields and better quality produce</li>
        <li>Environment-friendly farming practices</li>
        <li>Long-term sustainability of agricultural land</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Did You Know?</strong> Farmers using soil health card recommendations have reported reduced fertilizer use and improved productivity across several states.
    </div>

    <h2>Impact of Soil Health Card Scheme on Indian Agriculture</h2>

    <p>
        The Soil Health Card Scheme has played a significant role in changing fertilizer usage patterns in India. Many farmers have shifted from blanket fertilizer application to need-based nutrient management.
    </p>

    <p>
        This shift has not only improved soil health but also reduced groundwater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with excessive fertilizer use.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges in Implementation</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Limited availability of soil testing laboratories</li>
        <li>Delays in sample testing and card distribution</li>
        <li>Lack of awareness among some farmers</li>
        <li>Difficulty in understanding technical recommendations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To overcome these challenges, the government is expanding soil testing infrastructure and promoting digital soil health cards.
    </p>

    <h2>Role of Soil Health Card in Sustainable Farming</h2>

    <p>
        Sustainable agriculture depends on maintaining soil fertility over the long term. The Soil Health Card Scheme encourages judicious use of inputs, organic farming practices, and crop diversification.
    </p>

    <p>
        By improving soil structure and nutrient balance, the scheme helps farmers adapt to climate change and ensures food security for future generations.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        The <strong>Soil Health Card Scheme</strong> is a transformative initiative that places scientific knowledge directly in the hands of farmers. By understanding their soil’s needs, farmers can make smarter decisions that benefit both their income and the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Adoption of soil health card recommendations is essential for achieving sustainable agriculture, reducing costs, and improving productivity. Farmers are encouraged to actively participate in the scheme and use their soil health cards as a guide for better farming practices.
